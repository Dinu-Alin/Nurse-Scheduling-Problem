# Nurse-Scheduling-Problem
Genetic Algorithm for Nurse-Scheduling Problem

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

Developed a Python application implementing genetic algorithm to solve complex nurse scheduling optimization problem.
